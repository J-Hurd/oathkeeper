This oath is an attempt to bring the clarity and power of the Hippocratic Oath to modern fields

It shares the impetus and spirit of ["A Scientist Rebels](http://lanl-the-back-story.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-scientist-rebels.html) by MIT researcher [Norbert Weiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener) during the Cold War, in response to requests to weaponize his research into missiles.

Computer scientists and particularly security researchers must choose ethical conduct in the face of considerable pressure to abuse their skills.

I (fhightower) have created two other oaths specifically geared toward cyber security analysts and programmers that are based on the [full hippocratic oath] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath "Hippocratic Oath")
